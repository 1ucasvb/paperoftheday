# Paper of the Day

You know how we tend to save hundreds/thousands of papers in a "to read" folder for later?
But we never really get around to actually reading them, because we don't know where to start.

Well, this simple script is intended to fix that problem!

This script will scan the PDFs in that folder, and pick and open a paper at random for you.
The probability a paper is picked is inversely proportional to its number of pages, so
your laziness is taken into account. ;)

Check the source for how to set it up.

Happy reading!
